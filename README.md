<p>
I'm a Data Scientist and Technical Program Manager who is passionate about learning and working with others to solve challenging problems. When I'm not coding, I enjoy being outside exploring the Pacific Northwest with friends and family!</p>


### ðŸ’» Currently Working On:

* Completing [Azures Data Science Cloud Skills Challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/challenges?id=3F886A40-54D6-42DA-BDD5-BA0B210A04B9?OCID=AID3027817).

* Refining a [Machine Learning model](https://ml-stock-trading.azurewebsites.net/) to predict the daily high and low price for stocks using Gradient Boosting Regression and Recurrent Neural Networks. I'd like to host this model on Azure and build my own backtesting dashboard that tracks the return using different trading strategies based on the predictions. 

* Improving my ability to create advanced reports/dashboards in Power Bi. I built a [Seattle Crime Dashboard](https://seattle-crime-app.herokuapp.com/) using Flask/Plotly Dash and want to build something similar using Power Bi to further hone my expertise in using differnt tools to visualize data.

* Working with a team of fellow Data Scientists to compete in Kaggle's [Coleridge Initiative: Show US the Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/coleridgeinitiative-show-us-the-data).

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning / Re-Learning More About:

* Deep Learning with Python: I find neural networks fascinating and their application is the engine for many of today's newest technology (i.e. autonomous driving, voice-recognization products)

* Learning how to automate ML models using Azure Machine Learning studio as part of being Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:

* My journey from being a Military Officer to Technical Program Manager to Data Scientist. <i>Spoiler Alert</i> - it all stems from wanting to challenge myself and make an impact.
